# Post-rendering

Scripts here are for all the content that needs to be rendered after document is ready. In this project's example, the Ajax-ed contents are dynamically loaded after page renders, so partials need to be re-rendered as data changes. These are the scripts that handle the rendering of these situations.

They also include event binding callbacks.
